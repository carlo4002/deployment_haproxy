# HA proy installatiion

This playbook follows the same logic as its twin [postgres](https://github.com/carlo4002/deployment_postgres)
it is in charge to configure the HA proxy and it will be started by the ec2 instance data user script that is described [here](https://github.com/carlo4002/revolut_interview/blob/main/infra/haproxy_init.sh).
